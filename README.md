Hello! I'm Samuel A. MBA, Research Engineer interested in Artificial Intelligence for Computational Mechanics:

Research Engineer with expert knowledge in design of multi-objective civil infrastructures and several intensive projects. Seeking to focus my career on using Computational Methods to better understand and evolve structural analysis in key systems (Geotechnical, Biological, and Aerospace). 

My research focuses on computational mechanics, especially solutions that improve lives now, predict failure due to fatigue and fracture of materials subject to nonlinear loading and uncertainties, and support vibrant economies. Recent projects emphasize decreasing risks associated with highway: Road failure from low bearing capacity soils and embarkment slope stability.



Develop and use statistical machine learning methods to predict fatigue or fracture propagation due to large deformation. 

I am currently learning Mathematical Foundation for Machine Learning: Instructor by John Krohn
